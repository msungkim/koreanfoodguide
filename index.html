        <h2>Welcome to Korean Food</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Korean food is full of flavor, color, and a sense of eating together. Many people think only of spicy dishes, but Korean cuisine is much wider than that. There are warm broths, stews, and grilled foods with salty, sweet, sour, or smoky tastes. A table often includes rice, soup, and several small side dishes all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site introduces a few everyday Korean meals you can find at home, in school cafeterias, or in relaxed dining spots. It’s not a full guide to every regional dish, but a simple way to explore Korean food from a beginner’s point of view. Each section explains how the dish is eaten and what makes it special.
